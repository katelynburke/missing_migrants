## The Global Impact of Missing Migrants

### About:
*In order to analyze data from the Missing Migrant Project, I utilized Python Pandas and Tableau. The Missing Migrant Project (https://missingmigrants.iom.int/) tracks the deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide between the years of 2014 and 2019. I used the data from the project to create visualizations in order to gain insights about where and why migrants are going missing around the world. I present these visualizations in a Tableau story.*

### Data Used: 
Credit for the dataset used goes to 'IOM's Missing Migrants Project'.

More information about the project can be found here: https://missingmigrants.iom.int/

Changes made to the dataset in Python Pandas include: Dropped columns that were not needed for the analysis, separated the latitude and longitude coordinates, combined similar 'causes of death' together.

This image shows the devastation after a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on August 27th, 2019. The coastguard was able to rescue approximately 65 migrants, mostly from Sudan, but many are still missing at sea.

### Tableau Story: 
I chose to create a Tableau Story because I wanted to add narration to the visualizations. I also wanted to present the visualizations one-by-one so that connections could be seen between them. I felt that one dashboard would be an overload of information and it would be challenging to see the details in the visualizations. I did include one dashboard within the story that shows the deaths along migration routes.

Story Points: 
1) World map depicting the locations of missing migrants 
2) World map with a focus on the coast of Northern Africa 
3) World map with a focus on the deadly passageway from Libya to Italy (Mediterranean Sea)
4) World map with a focus on the United States/Mexico border
4) Migration causes of death (dashboard)
5) Missing migrants by month and year 
6) Deaths along migration routes

### Example Tableau visualizations included in the Story:

### Insights: 
* Very high concentration of migrant deaths off of the coast of Northern Africa (Mediterranean Sea). This area connecting Libya and Italy is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world. The most common cause of death off of the coast off of Northern Africa is drowning.
* High concentration of migrant deaths at the United States/Mexico border. Many causes of the deaths at the border unknown but several deaths are due to vehicle accidents, dehydration/starvation, and violence. 
* The most common cause of death of migrants worldwide is drowning. Many migrant causes of death are unknown. 
* The deadliest month for migrants between 2014-2018 was April 2015. A shipwreck in the Mediterranean, between Libya and Italy, lead to the deaths of over 800 migrants. The majority of the migrants were fleeing the poverty and conflict in Africa.
* The spread of missing migrants is not limited to only a few countries, but is a worldwide issue.
