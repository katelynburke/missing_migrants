## The Global Impact of Missing Migrants
*Using Python Pandas and Tableau to analyze data from the Missing Migrant Project. This project tracks the deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide between the years of 2014 and 2019.*

**Credit for the dataset used goes to 'IOM's Missing Migrants Project'.**

More information about the project can be found here: https://missingmigrants.iom.int/

Changes made to the dataset include: Dropped columns that were not needed for the analysis, separated the latitude and longitude coordinates, combined similar 'causes of death' together

This image shows the devastation after a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on August 27th, 2019. The coastguard was able to rescue approximately 65 migrants, mostly from Sudan, but many are still missing at sea.
